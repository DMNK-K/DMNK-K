I mostly program in C# and Javascript, although the C# projects tend to be private repos. However, this doesn't mean I don't dabble in some other software related things, like shadergraph in Unity.

Javascript projects are mostly for a webdev portfolio and can be very different from each other.

I've been using Unity Engine since around 2016, my main area of interest within game programming is procedural generation, but general level design and designing believable game mechanics are also something I like.
